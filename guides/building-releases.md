# Building releases



## Include other Nova applications

You can include other nova applications as part of your release. Just include them as regular rebar3-deps and
bootstrap them by telling your application to include them.

If you would include the application `nova_admin` into your app `testapp`, your sys.config could look something like this:

```erlang
{nova_applications, [
    #{name => "testapp",
      routes_file => "priv/testapp.routes.erl"},
    #{name => "nova_admin",
      prefix => "/admin"}
    ]}.
```

This tells nova that you want to include the `nova_admin` application and prefix all of its paths with `/admin`.

### App definition

| Key         | Definition                                                   | Default value        |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| name        | Name of the app                                              | *required*           |
| routes_file | Path to route file                                           | priv/$APP.routes.erl |
| prefix      | If the entire app should be prefixed                         | ""                   |
| security    | Secure all routes for this application with security handler | false                |


Example
```erlang
    #{name => "myapp",
      routes_file => "priv/myapp.routes.erl",
      prefix => "/my_app",
      security => {my_sec_handler, sec_function}
    }
```
